## Frontend
TBA

## Backend

* Written in (ill-formed) Go.
* Tested by hand (no guarantees).
* 0% unit test coverage (maybe next time)
* 10-20% of user story coverage (infinite times better than nothing!)


Deployed on [Heroku](fb-test.herokuapp.com) with the following command:
```
git subtree push --prefix the-boring-ostriches-backend heroku-fb master
```
